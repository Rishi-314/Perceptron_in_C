# Perceptron_in_C
- This project demonstrates how perceptrons learn binary classification problems and trains models to approximate logic gate functions
- The structured learning process, combined with gradient-based optimization, helped reinforce key programming and AI concepts. 
- Through practical implementation, we gained hands-on experience in neural network training, showcasing the power and limitations of single-layer perceptrons in classification problems.
